# Trees: a collection of mediocre radix tree implementations
This repo contains the following
- a radix tree
- a reversed rafix tree
- a "FilterTree" that can be used to filter url domains (originally for a primitive ad blocker)
None of them are particularly optimized, so I wouldn't recommend using them if you need high performance/throughput
